Wordle

1. Define an array of words
   Select a random word from the array using math.random
   store the word in an array (Array 1) (each letter in one index), this array will be used to store the letters of the winning word.

2. Create a keyboard for user input
   For each letter there will be an event listener and will be used to capture the letters entered by the user

3. Define User input array (Array 2)
   When the user clicks on a letter it will be added to (Array 2)
   Each letter will be stored in one index
   This array will store the user word and will be used to be compared with array 1 and check if the user entered the correct word or not.

4. Define a variable called (correctAnswer)
   Set it to false at the beginning, the purpose of this variable is to keep track of the user found the correct answer or not.
   If it is false the player will lose, otherwise player will win.

5. Define a variable called (numberOfAttempts)
   Used to track number of attempts for user (Increment by 1 after each user attempt until it reaches 5, user will lose if correctAnswer is false)
   If numberOfAttempts is less than 5 and numberOfAttempts is false , user will have a chance to enter a new word again.
   If numberOfAttempts is equal to 5 and correctAnswer is false user will lose.

6. Compare Array 1 and Array 2 (Repeated when user enter a new word)
   Each letter in Array 2 will be compared with all letters in array 1 (Loop through both arrays and compare the letters in correspondence index) to check if the player entered the correct word or not
   numberOfAttempts should be less than 5 before starting the steps below:
   - If the letter exist in Array 1 (same letter and same index) letter will turn into green (change css class)
   - If the letter exist in Array 1 (same letter but not same index) letter will turn into yellow (change css class)
   - If the letter does not exist in Array 1, it will be grey (change css class)
   - If all letters in Array 1 exactly match Array 2 ( correctAnswer is true) Player wins
